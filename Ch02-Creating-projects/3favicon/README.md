# Chapter 2: Add favicon to the project

## Objectives

- Add a favicon to the project

## Steps

1. Copy the `favicon.ico` file from this `README`'s directory to your `my-angular-albums` project `/src` directory, replacing the `favicon.ico` that was already there. NOTE: if it created a `favicon copy.ico` file, rename it to replace the original `favicon.ico`

1. We will need to restart our server for this change to take effect. Kill your server if it is running by pressing **ctrl + c**. Then run **npm start** 

1. You may need to do a hard refresh of the browser to see the icon change. In Chrome, do this by having the dev tools open and right-clicking the refresh icon of the browser. Choose hard refresh.
